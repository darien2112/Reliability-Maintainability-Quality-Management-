# Reliability-Maintainability-Quality-Management-
Materials &amp; study resources for Reliability, Maintainability &amp; Quality Management course from AFIT that I learned myself.

Course Description
------------------

Creating and sustaining military capability is the purpose of military leadership and management. Reliability and maintainability (R&M) are component characteristics, which define the ability of a product to perform its specified functions throughout its operational life. Component R&M of the military system are primary determinants of military capability. This course teaches fundamental R&M concepts. Additionally, probability theory is discussed and employed as a tool to quantitatively define these concepts. Topics to be discussed include the measures, which quantitatively define component R&M, the relationship between R&M, and the prediction of R&M measures.

Course Objectives
-----------------

Upon completion of this course each student shall be able to:

-   Understand and apply the fundamentals of the concepts of reliability, maintainability, and availability.

-   Understand the use of probability theory to quantify R&M concepts.

-   Understand and apply the measures which quantitatively define component R&M.
